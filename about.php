<p>Hi everyone! My name is Logan. I am currently going to college for Computer Science. I love coding and my favorite language is PHP. I am currently learning Java at school. I am very good with HTML and CSS and I actively avoid learning JavaScript. I do know JQuery and Ajax though. I am also a moderator for <a href="http://referrals.trhou.se/loganr">TeamTreeHouse</a>. I like to try and design binary circitry in Minecraft for fun. I have made a 3-bit comparer, which actually took a lot of brain power to get to work right. For my webserver, I run a Windows 2003 VPS. It has SSL set up on it, signed with PositiveSSL. It actually took a lot longer than you would think to set up.</p>

<p>I built this website from scratch myself. It does not use a database but instead a JSON for the information. I have the project on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/LoganRickert/PHP-Tableless-Blog-Site">which can be found here</a>. I will try to keep the GitHub up to date. I put the website and the files in the public domain so others can use it, learn from it, and more!</p>

<p>Sidenote: I am #3 in the world for most PHP points of all time on TeamTreeHouse :D</p>
